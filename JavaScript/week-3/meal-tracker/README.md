## Description

A meal tracking application. Users should be able to log foods they've eaten each day, including details about the meal and its number of calories.

**User Stories**

* As a user, I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with food name, calories and details.
* As a user, I want to view a list of foods I have logged.
* As a user, I want options to view all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).
* As a user, I want to click a food to edit its name, details or calories (in case I decide to pretend my fries were 100 calories instead of 365).
